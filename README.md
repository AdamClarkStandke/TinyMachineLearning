# TinyMachineLearning

Developing Embedded Applications from the book TinyML Cookbook by Gian Iodice &amp; Ronan Naughton. 

Tiny machine learning is broadly defined as a fast growing field of machine learning technologies and applications including hardware (dedicated integrated circuits), algorithms and software capable of performing on-device sensor (vision, audio, IMU, biomedical, etc.) data analytics at extremely low power, typically in the mW range and below, and hence enabling a variety of always-on use-cases and targeting battery operated devices.[^1]

This repository will implement most of the chapters from the book [TinyML Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/TinyML-Cookbook-artificial-intelligence-ultra-low-power/dp/180181497X) by Gian Iodice &amp; Ronan Naughton.
